// Package metrics exposes the consent gate's operational signals in the
// Prometheus text format.
//
// A component that can deny production traffic had no counters at all: nothing
// said how many requests were allowed, denied or failed open, how long the
// consent-manager was taking, how large the request-context store had grown, or
// how many audit records had been dropped. Logs were the only signal, and they
// are unstructured and rate-limited. Operationally that is flying blind — a
// misconfigured route that denies everything looks exactly like a quiet one.
//
// The exporter is hand-rolled rather than pulling in a Prometheus client, for
// the same reason the OTLP encoder is: this is a sidecar-adjacent plugin whose
// dependency tree is part of its risk surface, and the text format is small.
