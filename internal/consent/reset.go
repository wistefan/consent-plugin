// ResetCaches drops every package-wide cache: the participant credentials
// (token + derived provider self-description) and the DID -> self-description
// mappings.
//
// It exists for tests. They currently pass only because httptest allocates a
// fresh base URL per server, which happens to produce a fresh cache key; a test
// that reuses a URL, or one that runs in parallel with another, would otherwise
// see another test's token and fail in an order-dependent way. Production code
// must not call this: dropping a live token mid-flight only causes a re-fetch,
// but there is no reason to.
