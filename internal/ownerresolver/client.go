// Package ownerresolver is a client for the external OwnerResolver service.
//
// The OwnerResolver answers, from the DATA alone (never the requestor), whether
// a payload needs a consent check and who its data owner(s) are. The plugin
// calls it in the response phase and then verifies consent per resolved owner.

	// carried a payload I could not read" indistinguishable from "this response
	// had no payload". The resolver then judged ownership from the resource
	// descriptor alone, so a malformed-but-personal payload — a truncated write,
